# Hand Gesture Recognition Using AlexNet

## Project Overview
This project involves developing a hand gesture recognition model that accurately identifies and classifies various hand gestures from image or video data. The goal is to enable intuitive human-computer interaction and gesture-based control systems. The model is built using the AlexNet architecture, a deep learning model known for its effectiveness in image classification tasks.

## Features
- Hand Gesture Recognition: Accurately identifies and classifies different hand gestures.
- Deep Learning with AlexNet: Utilizes the AlexNet architecture to leverage its powerful feature extraction capabilities.
- Human-Computer Interaction: Enables intuitive gesture-based control for various applications.

## Technologies Used
- Python
- TensorFlow/Keras: For implementing and training the AlexNet model.
- OpenCV/PIL: For image processing and handling.
- NumPy & Pandas: For data manipulation and preprocessing.
- Matplotlib/Seaborn: For visualizing results and data.

## Usage
- Load the dataset: Ensure that the dataset of hand gestures is available in the specified path.
- Train the model: Execute the script to train the AlexNet model on the gesture data.
- Classify Gestures: Use the trained model to recognize and classify hand gestures from new images or video streams.
